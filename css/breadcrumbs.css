/* Breadcrumbs are a navigation aid used in websites or applications to show users their location in the site hierarchy. They help users understand the structure of a website and provide links to previous pages in the navigation path, making it easier to navigate back.

Visually, breadcrumbs usually appear as a series of links separated by symbols like > or /, representing the path a user has taken to get to the current page.

Example of Breadcrumbs:
Copy code
Home > Products > Electronics > Mobile Phones
Each part is clickable, allowing the user to quickly return to any of the previous sections (e.g., clicking "Products" would take the user back to the product listing).

Why Use Breadcrumbs?
Improved navigation: Easier for users to move back up the site hierarchy.
SEO benefits: Breadcrumbs can help search engines understand the structure of your site.
User experience: Provides clarity on where the user is within the site. */
